Caroline is currently pursuing her M.S. in Data Science at Northwestern University, with a projected graduation of December 2025. She has always been fascinated by the way numbers tell stories — whether that’s through identifying business trends, predicting outcomes, or crafting impactful visualizations.

Before the graduate program, she earned her B.S. in  NeuroScience from the University of Illinois at Chicago, where she originally intended to pursue medical school. During her gap year after completing her Bachelor's degree, she worked and volunteered in a handful of healthcare settings, where she realized that the medical field is not her true passion. 

Working in both startup atmospheres and for large corporations, Caroline excels in any workplace that challenges her, no matter the organization's size.

Outside of acedemia, she is passionate for the arts and music- playing 3 instruments from a young age and enjoying painting as a hobby.
